name:                basic-prelude
version:             0.7.0
synopsis:            An enhanced core prelude; a common foundation for alternate preludes.
description:
    The premise of @basic-prelude@ is that there are a lot of very commonly desired features missing from the standard @Prelude@, such as commonly used operators (@\<$\>@ and @>=>@, for instance) and imports for common datatypes (e.g., @ByteString@ and @Vector@). At the same time, there are lots of other components which are more debatable, such as providing polymorphic versions of common functions.
    .
    So @basic-prelude@ is intended to give a common foundation for a number of alternate preludes. The package provides two modules: @CorePrelude@ provides the common ground for other preludes to build on top of, while @BasicPrelude@ exports @CorePrelude@ together with commonly used list functions to provide a drop-in replacement for the standard @Prelude@.
    .
    Users wishing to have an improved @Prelude@ can use @BasicPrelude@. Developers wishing to create a new prelude should use @CorePrelude@.
